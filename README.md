# Monthly Upper Ocean Heat Content Forecasting

## Objective:

The rising ocean heat content (OHC) plays a critical role in climate change, affecting global weather patterns, sea levels, and marine ecosystems. However, understanding and predicting ocean heat fluctuations is essential for preparing for extreme weather events, improving climate models, and guiding global policy decisions.

This project aims to analyze and forecast monthly upper ocean heat content to detect long-term warming trends, identify seasonal variations, and predict future ocean temperature changes. Using ARIMA modeling, I explore how ocean heat levels have evolved over time and how they may change in the coming years.

By applying time series forecasting methods, we can answer key questions:

- Is the ocean heat content increasing at an alarming rate?
- Are there seasonal variations that affect global climate conditions?
- How accurately can we predict future ocean temperatures?
- Can forecasting models provide early warnings for extreme climate events?

Understanding these trends is crucial for climate scientists, policymakers, and environmental agencies to take informed action in mitigating climate change effects.

Data Set is obtained from the Our World in Data's website, which can be found at: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/monthly-upper-ocean-heat?time=2010-02-15..latest
